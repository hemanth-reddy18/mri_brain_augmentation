# MRI Project Walkthrough

## Execution Results

I have successfully refactored the MRI project, moved it to the `mri` directory, and executed the following steps:

1.  **Data Generation**: Created mock 3D MRI data (BraTS format) in `mri/mri_data`.
2.  **Data Loading**: Successfully loaded the data using `MRIDataset` and `DataLoader`.
3.  **Visualization**: Generated a preview of the MRI scans.

### Generated Preview

Here is a preview of the loaded MRI batch (middle slice of 3D volume):

### Execution Output
```
Loading data from: /Users/v.hemanthkumarreddy/.gemini/antigravity/mri/mri_data/train
Found 15 MRI files.

Iterating through DataLoader...
Batch 1:
  Image Batch Shape: torch.Size([4, 32, 32, 32])
